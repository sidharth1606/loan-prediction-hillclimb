# Loan Prediction using Hill Climb Optimization

## Overview
This project predicts loan approvals using machine learning algorithms (LightGBM, CatBoost) combined with hill-climb optimization and Optuna for hyperparameter tuning. It demonstrates a complete data science workflow â€” from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering and selection
- Model training with LightGBM and CatBoost
- Hyperparameter tuning with hill-climb optimization + Optuna
- Evaluation metrics and results visualization

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, LightGBM, CatBoost, Optuna, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
